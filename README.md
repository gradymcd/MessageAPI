# MessageAPI
## Note: Currently under heavy development, expect things to be painfully insecure and the API to contstatly change. Do not use this project for anything other than testing and do not expect any data to be secure
MessageAPI is a way for messaging apps to communicate with each other through a common API. This, in theory allows users to use which ever messaging app they please without needing their friends to use the same app.
